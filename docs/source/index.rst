The Dicey IPC library
=====================

**Dicey** is library for quick and easy IPC (Inter-Process Communication), written in C.

Dicey is heavily inspired by D-Bus, with a strong focus on providing *multi-platform, 1:N IPC* in a simple and easy to use manner. 

In its current incarnation Dicey runs on Windows and most Unix-like systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS.
