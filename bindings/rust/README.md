# Dicey Rust bindings

I have big plans about using Rust for future Dicey-related developments, but sadly we don't have time to write these bindings
right now. If you are interested in helping us, please let us know!

Currently, this directory only contains a crude bindgen-generated wrapper around the Dicey C API. It's not very useful,
but it's a good starting point for anyone who wants to help us with the Rust bindings.
